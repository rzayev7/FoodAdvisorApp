Welcome to Fooderra, where you can quickly access the recipes for your favorite dishes, share your blogs with others, and explore theirs. The inspiration behind our project stems from [Foodvisor](https://www.foodvisor.io/en/). We initiated the process by creating our own Figma file, which served as a blueprint for our developers in crafting the user interface for our platform.
